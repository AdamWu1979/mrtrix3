    //! A first-in first-out thread-safe item queue
    /*! This class implements a thread-safe means of pushing data items into a
     * queue, so that they can each be processed in one or more separate
     * threads. It has somewhat unusual usage, which consists of the following
     * steps:
     * - Create an instance of a Thread::Queue
     * - Create one or more instances of the corresponding
     * Thread::Queue::Writer class, each constructed with a reference to the
     * queue. Each of these instances will automatically notify the queue that
     * its corresponding thread will be writing to the queue.
     * - Create one or more instances of the corresponding
     * Thread::Queue::Reader class, each constructed with a reference to the
     * queue. Each of these instances will automatically notify the queue that
     * its corresponding thread will be reading from the queue.
     * - Launch all threads, one per instance of Thread::Queue::Writer or
     *   Thread::Queue::Reader. Note that one of these threads can be the
     *   current thread - simply invoke the respective functor's execute()
     *   method directly once all other threads have been launched.
     * - Within the execute() method of each thread with a
     * Thread::Queue::Writer:
     *   - create an instance of Thread::Queue::Writer::Item, constructed from
     *   the corresponding Thread::Queue::Writer;
     *   - perform processing in a loop:
     *     - prepare the item using pointer semantics (i.e. *item or
     *     item->method());
     *     - use the write() method of this class to write to the queue;
     *     - break out of loop if write() returns \c false.
     *   - when the execute() method returns, the destructor of the
     *   Thread::Queue::Writer::Item class will notify the queue that its
     *   thread has finished writing to the queue.
     * - Within the execute() method of each thread with a
     * Thread::Queue::Reader:
     *   - create an instance of Thread::Queue::Reader::Item, constructed from
     *   the corresponding Thread::Queue::Reader;
     *   - perform processing in a loop:
     *     - use the read() method of this class to read the next item from the
     *     queue;
     *     - break out of the loop if read() returns \c false;
     *     - process the item using pointer semantics (i.e. *item or
     *     item->method()).
     *   - when the execute() method returns, the destructor of the
     *   Thread::Queue::Reader::Item class will notify the queue that its
     *   thread has finished reading from the queue.
     * - If all reader threads have returned, the queue will notify all writer
     * threads that processing should stop, by returning \c false from the next
     * write attempt.
     * - If all writer threads have returned and no items remain in the queue,
     * the queue will notify all reader threads that processing should stop, by
     * returning \c false from the next read attempt.
     *
     * The additional member classes are designed to be used in conjunction
     * with the MRtrix multi-threading interface. In this system, each thread
     * corresponds to an instance of a functor class, and its execute() method
     * is the function that will be run within the thread (see Thread::Exec for
     * details). For this reason:
     * - The Thread::Queue instance is designed to be created before any of the
     *   threads.
     * - The Thread::Queue::Writer and Thread::Queue::Reader classes are
     *   designed to be used as members of each functor, so that each functor
     *   must construct these classes from a reference to the queue within
     *   their own constructor. This ensures each thread registers their
     *   intention to read or write with the queue \e before their thread is
     *   launched.
     * - The Thread::Queue::Writer::Item and Thread::Queue::Reader::Item
     *   classes are designed to be instantiated within each functor's
     *   execute() method. They must be constructed from a reference to a
     *   Thread::Queue::Writer or Thread::Queue::Reader respectively, ensuring
     *   no reads or write can take place without having registered with the
     *   queue. Their destructors will also unregister from the queue, ensuring
     *   that each thread unregisters as soon as the execute() method returns,
     *   and hence \e before the thread exits.
     *
     * The Queue class performs all memory management for the items in the
     * queue. For this reason, the items are accessed via the Writer::Item &
     * Reader::Item classes. This allows items to be recycled once they have
     * been processed, reducing overheads associated with memory
     * allocation/deallocation. 
     *
     * \note It is important that all instances of Thread::Queue::Writer and
     * Thread::Queue::Reader are created \e before any of the threads are
     * launched, to avoid any race conditions at startup.
     *
     * The use of Thread::Queue is best illustrated with an example:
     * \code
     * // the type of objects that will be sent through the queue:
     * class Item {
     *   public:
     *     ...
     *     // data members
     *     ...
     * };
     *
     *
     * // The use a typedef is recommended to help with readability (and typing!):
     * typedef Thread::Queue<Item> MyQueue;
     *
     *
     * // this class will write to the queue:
     * class Sender {
     *   public:
     *     // construct the 'writer' member in the constructor:
     *     Sender (MyQueue& queue) : writer (queue) { }
     *
     *     void execute () {
     *       // use a local instance of Thread::Queue<Item>::Writer::Item to write to the queue:
     *       MyQueue::Writer::Item item (writer);
     *       while (need_more_items()) {
     *         ...
     *         // prepare item
     *         *item = something();
     *         item->set (something_else);
     *         ...
     *         if (!item.write()) break; // break if write() returns false
     *       }
     *     }
     *
     *   private:
     *     MyQueue::Writer writer;
     * };
     *
     *
     * // this class will read from the queue:
     * class Receiver {
     *   public:
     *     // construct the 'reader' member in the constructor:
     *     Receiver (MyQueue& queue) : reader (queue) { }
     *
     *     void execute () {
     *       // use a local instance of Thread::Queue<Item>::Reader::Item to read from the queue:
     *       MyQueue::Reader::Item item (reader);
     *       while ((item.read())) { // break when read() returns false
     *         ...
     *         // process item
     *         do_something (*item);
     *         if (item->status()) report_error();
     *         ...
     *         if (enough_items()) return;
     *       }
     *     }
     *
     *   private:
     *     MyQueue::Reader reader;
     * };
     *
     *
     * // this is where the queue and threads are created:
     * void my_function () {
     *   // create an instance of the queue:
     *   MyQueue queue;
     *
     *   // create all functors from a reference to the queue:
     *   Sender sender (queue);
     *   Receiver receiver (queue);
     *
     *   // once all functors are created, launch their corresponding threads:
     *   Thread::Exec sender_thread (sender);
     *   Thread::Exec receiver_thread (receiver);
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * \par Rationale for the Writer, Reader, and Item member classes
     *
     * The motivation for the use of additional member classes to perform the
     * actual process of writing and reading to and from the queue is related
     * to the need to keep track of the number of processes currently using the
     * queue. This is essential to ensure that threads are notified when the
     * queue is closed. This happens either when all readers have finished
     * reading; or when all writers have finished writing and no items are left
     * in the queue. This is complicated by the need to ensure that the various
     * operations are called in the right order to avoid deadlocks.
     *
     * There are essentially 4 operations that need to take place:
     * - registering an intention to read/write from/to the queue
     * - launching the corresponding thread
     * - unregistering from the queue
     * - terminating the thread
     *
     * For proper multi-threaded operations, these operations must take place
     * in the order above. Moreover, each operation must be completed for
     * all users of the queue before any of them can perform the next
     * operation. The use of additional member classes ensures that threads
     * have to register their intention to read or write from the queue, and
     * that they unregister from the queue once their processing is done.
     *
     * While this could have been achieved simply with the appropriate member
     * functions (i.e. register(), unregister(), %read() & %write() methods in
     * the main Queue class), this places a huge burden on the developer to get
     * it right. Using these member functions reduces the chance of coding
     * errors, and in fact reduces the total amount of code that needs to be
     * written to use the Queue in a safe manner.
     *
     * The Item classes additionally simplify the memory management of the
     * items in the queue, by preventing direct access to the underlying
     * pointers, and ensuring the Queue itself is responsible for all
     * allocation and deallocation of items as needed.

    //! convenience functions to set up and run multi-threaded queues.
     /*! This set of convenience functions simplify the process of setting up a
      * multi-threaded processing chain that should meet most users' needs.
      * The differences between the three functions are as follows:
      * - run_queue_threaded_source(): Multiple 'source' threads feed data
      *     onto the queue, which are received by a single 'sink' thread.
      * - run_queue_threaded_sink(): A single 'source' thread feeds data
      *     onto the queue, which are then received and processed by multiple
      *     'sink' threads.
      * - run_queue_threaded_pipe(); A 'source' thread places data onto a
      *     queue. These data are processed by multiple 'pipe' threads,
      *     which place the processed data onto a second queue. A single
      *     'sink' thread then reads the data from this second queue.
      * 
      * The template types consist of the functor classes, and
      * the type(s) of the item(s) that will be passed through the queue(s).
      * Note that in the case of run_queue_threaded_pipe(), there are two
      * queues involved, and these queues may have different types.
      *
      * The actual arguments correspond to an instance of both the source &
      * sink functors (as well as the pipe functor if run_queue_threaded_pipe()
      * is used), and an item instance for each queue (provided purely to specify
      * the type of object to pass through the queue(s)).
      *
      * Where more than one thread is to be used for a functor, additional
      * instances of the functor will be created using the relevant class's
      * copy constructor. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that the
      * copy constructor behaves appropriately.
      *
      * For the functor that is being multi-threaded, the number of threads
      * instantiated will depend on the "NumberOfThreads" entry in the MRtrix
      * confugration file, or can be set at the command-line using the
      * -nthreads option.
      *
      *
      * \par Source: the input functor 
      * The Source class must at least provide the method:
      * \code 
      * bool operator() (Type& item);
      * \endcode
      * This function prepares the \a item passed to it, and should return \c
      * true if further items need to be prepared, or \c false to signal that
      * no further items are to be sent through the queue (at which point the
      * corresponding thread(s) will exit).
      *
      * \par Sink: the output functor 
      * The Sink class must at least provide the method:
      * \code 
      * bool operator() (const Type& item);
      * \endcode
      * This function processes the \a item passed to it, and should return \c
      * true when ready to process further items, or \c false to signal the end
      * of processing (at which point the corresponding thread(s) will exit).
      *
      * \par Pipe: the processing functor (for run_queue_threaded_pipe() only)
      * The Pipe class must at least provide the method:
      * \code 
      * bool operator() (const Type1& item_in, Type2& item_out);
      * \endcode
      * This function processes the \a item_in passed to it, and prepares
      * \a item_out for the next stage of the pipeline. It should return \c
      * true when ready to process further items, or \c false to signal the end
      * of processing (at which point the corresponding thread(s) will exit).
      *
      *
      * \par Example usage
      * \code
      * // The item type to be passed through the queue:
      * class Item {
      *   public:
      *     size_t n;
      * };
      *
      *
      * // The Source class prepares each item to be sent through the queue:
      * class Source {
      *   public:
      *     Source () : count (0) { }
      *
      *     // The kernel responsible for preparing each item to be sent.
      *     // This simply generates 1000000 items with incrementing count.
      *     bool operator() (Item& item) {
      *       item.n = count++;
      *       return count < 1000000;
      *     }
      *
      *     size_t count;
      * };

      * //   onto another:
      * class Pipe {
      *   public:
      *     Pipe () { }
      *
      *     // The kernel responsible for processing the data.

     //! convenience functions to set up and run custom multi-threaded queues.
     /* This set of functions differ from Thread::run_queue_threaded_* and
      * Thread::run_batched_queue_threaded_* in that the number of threads
      * executed for the source, pipe and sink classes is entirely up to the
      * programmer (and can even be determined at run-time).
      *
      * Usage differs from the previous functions in that the number of
      * threads for each class in the processing chain is specified as a
      * function parameter. If this number is set to 0, then the maximum
      * number of threads (as specified by the NumberOfThreads entry in the
      * configuration file, or the -nthreads command line option) will be
      * invoked.
      *
      * Functions are available for both standard queues and batched queues.
      *
      * Note that to invoke one of these functions, a valid copy-constructor
      * MUST be defined for ALL functors involved (even if only a single
      * thread is used for that functor, and hence it is not actually copy-
      * constructed). If only one functor the queue chain is to be
      * multi-threaded, it is recommended that the programmer use one of the
      * run_queue_threaded_* or run_batched_queue_threaded_* functions instead;
      * these do not require valid copy-constructors for those functors that
      * are not copy-constructed, and the resulting function call is much more
      * readable.
      *
      * Example usage:
      * \code
      * int main (...)
      * {
      *   Source source;
      *   Pipe pipe;
      *   Sink sink;
      *
      *   // Run half the maximum number of threads for the source, and the
      *   // same number for the sink:
      *   run_queue_custom_threading (source, Thread::number_of_threads()/2, Item(), sink, Thread::number_of_threads()/2);
      *
      *   // Run a batched queue (batch size 100), with a single source
      *   // thread and as many sink threads as possible
      *   // (Note that this is identical to run_batched_queue_threaded_sink()):
      *   run_batched_queue_custom_threading (source, 1, Item(), 100, sink, 0);
      *
      *   // Run two queues, with multi-threaded source and pipe functors,
      *   but only a single sink thread:
      *   run_queue_custom_threading (source, 0, Item(), pipe, 0, Item(), sink, 1);
      *
      *   // Run two batched queues (both with batch size 100), with a single
      *   // source thread, and multiple pipe and sink threads:
      *   run_batched_queue_custom_threading (source, 1, Item(), 100, pipe, 0, Item(), 100, sink, 0);
      *
      * }
